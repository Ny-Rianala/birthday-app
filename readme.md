# Birthday App

There is file in the project called person.json. It contains a list of persons, and we want to add all those people to our birthday list app.

## Features
The app will show the list of people, sorted by the ones who will have their birthday the soonest.

The users will be able to add a new element on the list in the app:

-   first name
-   last name
-   birthday
-   an url for their avatar image

The users can edit an element on the list. When you click the edit button, a modal will appear with a form inside, to edit any attribute.

The users can delete an element. There is a modal that will ask if you're sure to delete that element.

The users can filter name and select a month at the same time to search for people's birthday.

Every action is persisted into the local storage.
